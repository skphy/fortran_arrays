# fortran integers, floats and arrays
Fortran (fortran90/95/2003/2008/2018) integers, floats, and arrays handling for better understanding.

The information related to fortran data types is taken from the link: https://www.fortran90.org

Things to learn from this short tutorial:

  1. Array handling

     see here to follow the link: `Fortran array access `<https://github.com/skphy/fortran_arrays/blob/main/array_handling.rst>`_

  2. Array storage: column or row major through fortran 

     see the example: `columnmajor Fortan `<https://github.com/skphy/fortran_arrays/blob/main/array_printing.rst>`_
